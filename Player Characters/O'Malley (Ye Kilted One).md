## Backstory
_Ugh.  What just happened?_

Incomplete images flashed through my mind.  Running through a small village. Hiding in a small hovel while snarling creatures crawled across the roof.  Looking up to see a beam falling and whispering “Sweet Mercy, save me.”

Damn.  Why does my head hurt so much? I open my eyes only to have the headache sharpen at the glaring sunlight.  Oh sweet mercy that was a mistake.  Quickly closing my eyes and covering it with my arm.  I laid there for what seemed like ages.  Alright, lad, you can’t be a layabout all day.  Gotta get up sometime.  Slowly building up my courage, I sit up and open my eyes to finally observe the world around me.  Squinting against the light I find myself sitting in a grove of tall trees.  The twilling of song birds dancing across the grove.  The pleasant breeze rustling the branches.  This would actually be quite pleasant place if it weren’t for this damnable headache.

“Sweet child, let me help with that.” a voice unexpectedly whispers in my ear.

Jerking my head to look, “What the?  Who said that?”  The sudden movement causing my headache to split open again causing me to fall back with my hands holding my head and groan loudly.  Damn, that was a mistake.

“You are not damned, child.  Quit saying that.”  The voice whispers in my ear, sternly this time.

Alright, I definitely am not imagining that. 

“No, child, I am not your imagination.  Now lay still and feel my blessing.” 

A wash of pleasant warmth crowns my head and the energy sends shivers throughout my body.

“Well, I’ll be damned.  That felt wonderful.”

“Child… Once again, You Are Not Damned. Now Quit. Saying. That.”  The voice enunciated in my ear.

“My apologies.  Just not used to bodiless whispers in my ear.  Last time anyone whispered in my ear, it was a beautiful lass and she used a more sultry voice and we definitely did some damnable deeds together.” I chuckle at my own humor.

“Child, you are not damned.  I am [[Kalina, Goddess of Peace]] and heard your prayer for mercy from the creatures Pravus descended on your home.  I have saved you, I pulled you out of the clutches of death, and brought you to this realm to act as one of my agents.  To counter the evil darkness that Pravus spreads.  To bring peace to the people of this realm.  Now quit being difficult for you are trying my patience and making me doubt the mercy I took on you.”

“Sorry, milady.”

“You are forgiven.”

“I am grateful for whatever grace you bestowed on me but I’ve got to be honest I’m not sure what you are talking about.” I say as I shake my head. “I mean, I’m sure what you say is the truth but I just don’t remember any of it.  I’ve got snippets and images of before I woke up here in this grove but everything else is just foggy.”

“Hmmmm. You took a harder blow to the head from that beam than I realised.  Well, no matter.  Know this, you are now my agent in this realm.  Your life would have been forfeit had I not saved you.  But I have seen in your heart that of a good soul.  You will bring about peace to many of the citizens here.  Have faith that what knowledge and skills you are in need of will be provided.  Take this staff and this pack to help you fiend off the evils you come face to face with.  Now head south from here for there is a small homestead that is in need of your assistance.”

Suddenly, a bright flash blinds me and in its place there stood a weapon.  A brilliant quarterstaff covered in intricate runes stands straight up sticking out of the soil in front of me.

“Yes ma’am!”  I mean, I surely can’t argue with a Goddess.  Especially not one who saved my life.  So she says.

“No you can’t argue with me and DON’T DOUBT MY SAVING YOUR LIFE!”

Grabbing the staff and the pack next to it I skedaddle out of there before I get myself into more trouble. Damn I’ve got to remember that she can hear my thoughts.

It didn’t take me long to find the homestead.  Sounds of snarling came to me as soon as I exited the grove.  I instantly started to sprint towards the sounds to find what looked like two demonic dog things circling a small farmhouse.  Continuing my sprint, I managed to get within swinging distance of one before it noticed me.  Swinging my staff upwards I catch the creature under its muzzle as it lunges at me sending it sprawling backwards against the house falling limply on the ground.

“Aha!” I yelled only to see the other one bearing down on me.  “Oh shite!” Turning, I run the opposite way.  _Sweet mercy, what do I do now?_  

“Have faith in me.” The Goddess whispers in my ear.  Immediately my mind is awashed with knowledge of spells bestowed upon me.  

Turning back to face the creature, I sweep aside a lunge from the damn dog sending it landing to the side.  As it begins to stand I summon down radiant flames from the sky smiting the creature before it has the chance to regain its feet.  

“Take that you stupid mutt!” I yell while pointing at the smoldering corpse only to be knocked over from behind by the other damn dog.  “Ummfff” comes out of my mouth as I hit the ground managing to turn in my fall to land on my back.  Instantly, the demon dog is on me. Holding back its snapping muzzle with my forearm I struggle to keep it from my throat.  Placing my other hand on the creature’s chest I look it in the eye and say, “Skadoosh.”  A beam of crackling energy blasts the thing backwards, flying into what looked to be the outhouse.  

Slowly regaining my feet I look around at my handy work.  “Well I’ll be damned, not too shabby if I do say so myself.”

“For the last time, you are not damned.  You are an agent of mine and have done a marvelous job of bringing peace to this homestead.”

“Oh, right.” I say as I look to the two smoldering corpses, “Peace be unto you damned demon pups.”

A sigh of exasperation breathes across my ear.

“Now, see, if you’re going to breathe onto my ear could you at least do it in a sultry voice?”

“THAT’S IT!  YOU HAVE TRIED MY PATIENCE!  I’m going to pawn you off onto one of my Archangels and he can deal with you!”

……..

“Ummmm, okay.  I admit I may have taken it too far with that one.”

The silence continued.  

“Well, shit.  I may not remember my previous life but I am starting to think I was a major dumbass.”  

As I approach the farmhouse, I call out “It’s okay to come out now!  I don’t see any more of those creatures!”  I see one of the shutters crack open and quickly shut again.  

“Are you sure there aren’t any more out there?” a voice calls out to me.

Looking around and seeing no more danger, “Yes, I am sure.  You are safe.”

The front door opens and the farmer, wife, a young boy, and a little girl come out thanking me profusely.

“Thank you kind sir.” says the farmer. “We are forever in your debt.  I would not have been able to hold them off without losing someone but now we are all safe because of you.”

“No need to thank me sir.  Give you appreciation to the Goddess Kalina, for it was truly her who saw your need and sent me to intercede.”  

“It’s about time you show some respect for your Goddess.” I flinch as the new, bold voice whispers in my ear.

“You okay mister?” the wife asks of me.

Composing myself I reply, “Uh, yeah.  I thought I had heard a gnat buzzing my ear.”

“A GNAT? HA!” the voice whispers more sternly.  “I’m going to enjoy ordering you around now”

The little girl steps up to me and asks, “What is your name mister?  So that we can tell everyone the name of our guardian.”  

“Uh?  That’s an excellent question, little one.  Ummm….”

“Tim” the voice whispers.

“Tim?” I tell everyone questioningly.  Then turning my head I whisper back, “seriously?”

“Not at all.  HAHAHAHAHA!” the voice replies.

“Ass” I whisper back.  “Uh, yes, my name is Tim.”

“Not even close.” he whispers.

“Oh thank you. Oh thank you.” I hear as they all continue to rain their praises onto me.

“It’s time to go” the voice demands.

“Once again send your praises and prayers to Kalina.  Duty calls so I must be on my way so you all take care.”  I say as I jog away.

“So who is my new caretaker that I must have whispering sweet nothings into my ear?”

“Ha!  I am your new patron Uriel, the Archangel of Peace, and you will address me with more respect!”

“Copy that, Archangel Uranus.”

The lightning strike in my face throws me backwards onto my ass.  “Right.” I groan, “Sorry, Patron Uriel.  I’ve learned my lesson.”

“I doubt it.” he says. “But I think I will enjoy this new agent of mine.”

“Soooo…. What’s my real name?  Liam?”

“Liam?  You’re definitely not worthy of that name and no, I think I’ll keep tormenting you while you continue to guess.” he says laughing into my ear.

I groan loudly during my jog down the road.  This will definitely be an interesting new life of mine but, honestly, I’m looking forward to it.
