Half-Orc brawler. Magnus always loved the sea, and he got captured by slave traders when he tried to sneak onto a ship. Walter “bargained” with the traders while Ember set the slaves free, and Magnus took up sailing. Years later, he came back to Aquanona and Walter hired him as captain of the Merry Weather.
