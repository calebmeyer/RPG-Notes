[[Faercrath (Fury) Darzgoss]]'s father. 

General in the dragonborn army. Had Fury with a blue dragonborn mother. Wanted a metallic kid, got a blue one, so he threw Fury into the rank and file. Normally only metallic dragons can have officer roles in the army, but Fury was too good a fighter/leader.

Current wielder of the [[Shoulders of Stryd]]

Current location: Far in the south, near Orc and Goblin territory (Orcs are massing due to being stirred up by an agent of Pravus)
