### Corrupt Water
At the start of each of the wastrilith's turns, exposed water within 30 feet of it is befouled. Underwater, this effect lightly obscures the area until a current clears it away. Water in containers remains corrupted until it evaporates.

A creature that consumes this foul water or swims in it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the foul water for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (4d8) poison damage and is poisoned until it finishes a long rest.

The wastrilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
#### Multiattack
The wastrilith makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack, and it uses Grasping Spout.

#### Bite
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 4d6 + 4 piercing damage.

#### Claws
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 3d6 + 4 slashing damage.

#### Grasping Spout
The wastrilith magically launches a spout of water at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw, and it has disadvantage if it's underwater. On a failed save, it takes 22 (4d8 + 4) acid damage and is pulled up to 60 feet toward the wastrilith. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

### Bonus Actions
#### Undertow
If the wastrilith is underwater, it causes all water within 60 feet of it to be difficult terrain for other creatures until the start of its next turn.
