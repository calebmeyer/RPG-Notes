## Cave
Characters are outside of a cave. As they enter, they notice it's getting cold again.

There is a set of 4 Naga: ![[Naga.png]] guarding what appears to be a sheet of solid ice.

### Map
![[Luthien Cave.png]]

### Pravus and Luthien summon a wastrilith
When the players go up to the ice, they can wipe it off to see dozens if not hundreds of naga all facing Luthien who appears to be standing in front of a ritual circle. 

Ice has 100HP, 5AC, and resistance to everything except magical fire.

If the players watch, they'll hear a terrible voice: "This is your last chance, Luthien. You will crush the merfolk! If not, you will be of no use to me."

With a DC 15 Perception check (hearing), the players will hear [[Luthien]]'s response: "I will not fail you, Pravus"

Regardless, then a Naga will step forward into the circle and tendrils of inky blackness will swirl around her. Her form will grow and change, and her hands will grow into giant claws. Then all will start swimming away toward the town.

## The Town of Maricia
The few remaining town guards will be fighting with the Naga. They would be losing, except that [[King Prow]] and [[Fishalicious]] are fighting with them. With that, it's a pretty close fight. That leaves [[Luthien]] and the Wastrilith to lay waste to the players.

Each round at the end of the round, roll 4d6. The lowest d6 for the good guy deaths and the other 3d6 for the bad guys. There are 12 guards + Fishalicious (2) and Prow (3) on the good side, and 50 total naga. If all good guys die, Luthien will attempt to steal the [[Gloves of Mahiya]] and get away. If all the bad guys die, Prow and Fishalicious will join the players.

## Aftermath
Prow: Heroes, Harmony's Wake, you have saved my city and my people this day. It is clear you are worthy of the Hallowed Ones' Artifacts. Fishalicious?

Fishalicious: I hereby bestow upon you the [[Gloves of Mahiya]]. Luthien will not be the last of Pravus' lieutenants who tries to take them. Keep them safe, and use them well.

Prow: You will always be welcome here, and if there is ever anything my people can do for you in the future, call upon us. I know you didn't do this for money, but your good deeds shall be rewarded.

Each player gets 500gp, and the party gets an [[Elixir of Health]], a [[Potion of Greater Healing]], and the [[Trident of the Deluge]]
