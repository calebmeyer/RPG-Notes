## Cave
Characters are outside of a cave. As they enter, they notice it's getting cold again.

There is a set of 4 Naga: ![[Naga.png]] guarding what appears to be a sheet of solid ice.

### Pravus and Luthien summon a wastrilith
When the players go up to the ice, they can wipe it off to see dozens if not hundreds of naga all facing Luthien who appears to be standing in front of a ritual circle. 

Ice has 100HP, 5AC, and resistance to everything except magical fire.

If the players watch, they'll hear a terrible voice: "This is your last chance, Luthien. You will crush the merfolk! If not, you will be of no use to me."

With a DC 15 Perception check (hearing), the players will hear [[Luthien]]'s response: "I will not fail you, Pravus"

Regardless, then a Naga will step forward into the circle and tendrils of inky blackness will swirl around her. Her form will grow and change, and her hands will grow into giant claws. Then all will start swimming away toward the town.
