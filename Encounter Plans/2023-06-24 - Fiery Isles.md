## Problem 1 - How to catch the boat/get to land
The players could ask the merfolk's aid, which would get them quickly to the fiery isles. They could swim, but would show up exhausted. They could try to repair the sinking dragonborn ship enough to get there. Or they could do something else.

## Encounter 1 - When they get to land
![[Waterfall beach.png]]

_As you land on an unknown island, you can tell you're in the fiery isles by the giant jungle trees surrounding this small cove. A few feet from the shore are some low cliffs, about 10 feet at their highest point, with a waterfall cascading down from the center. Spindly planks stick up at the shoreline, but if a dock ever adorned them, it's long gone._

Perception Check:
<12 - The gentle burble of the waterfall fills your ears, and the cliff line and trees block vision of anything further in. 
12 - It's too quiet here, there should be birds cawing or something. 
15 - It's too quiet here, and those mounds of sand don't look entirely natural
18 - There's crab eyes sticking out of those mounds of sand over there
