## Pre-Game Encounter - Tabber, Corom, and Zamorak fight on the ship
As the 3 dragonborn ships surround the Harmony's Call, wizards teleport fighters onto the deck. [[Zamorak]] from the crows nest gets several fireballs off before he is subdued. (Let Tabber, Corom fight). Tabber will try to escape, try to chuck his [[Artifact Aquirer]] and get caught in a hold person. Tabber and Corom will be taken below the decks and tied up. Zamorak will be left above putting wind in the sails until he's no longer useful, then executed.

## Problem 1 - How to catch the boat/get to land
The players could ask the merfolk's aid, which would get them quickly to the fiery isles. They could swim, but would show up exhausted. They could try to repair the sinking dragonborn ship enough to get there. Or they could do something else.

As they chase the boats, they see a little ball of metal floating in the water with a blinking red light. As the enemy ships get further and further away, the blinks become slower and slower, until they eventually stop.

Alternatively, Tabber/Corom can try to escape their binds and slow down the boats. They each will be at 5 HP and their stuff will be shoved into a locked wooden chest. They'll be bound in ropes (DC 16 Acrobatics to escape, DC 20 stealth to do so without the dragonborn guard watching them noticing). If they fail, they get knocked out. Zamorak is being forced to put wind in the sails, and if the other two escape, they can get off the boat with him.

The enemy ships get away, out of sight. The first land they see is this beach.

## Encounter 1 - When they get to land
![[Waterfall beach.png]]

_As you land on an unknown island, you can tell you're in the fiery isles by the giant jungle trees surrounding this small cove. A few feet from the shore are some low cliffs, about 10 feet at their highest point, with a waterfall cascading down from the center. A dock is halfway done collapsing into the water._

Perception Check:
<12 - The gentle burble of the waterfall fills your ears, and the cliff line and trees block vision of anything further in. 
12 - It's too quiet here, there should be birds cawing or something. 
15 - It's too quiet here, and those mounds of sand don't look entirely natural
18 - There's crab eyes sticking out of one of those mounds of sand over there
21 - Is that a chest under the surviving bits of the dock?

**Roll for Initiative!**
Fighting 1 Giant Crab and 1 Giant Turtle

When a player character goes down, or the fight is over, have vines appear restraining everyone except Hruuk (DC 20 Strength save to not get grabbed). "Who are you, and why are you here?" the Circle of Druids asks. 

> Hruuk, you are blessed by Mighty Alam, as are we. We have much to learn from each other. But first we need your help. Our leader Ballar found something, a black stone. We are loyal subjects of the isles and he took it to give to the king. That was yesterday. This morning a bird came to tell us he's been locked in the prison in Kel'Rod.
> 
> Wait! You all look exhausted. This isn't the right time for a stealth mission anyway. We should go to the city tonight, under the cover of nightfall. Here, we know a safe place you can sleep. 

The druids take the party under the waterfall, to a cave lit by glowing green mushrooms. There are several bedrolls over piles of moss that look very comfortable. The party can rest up, snack on some fruit from the nearby trees, get a drink from the fresh water of the waterfall, etc. 

That night they'll go to Kel'Rod. 

## Social Encounter - Guards at the gate
"Halt. Who goes there?" asks the bored looking silver dragonborn at the gate to the city.

If the party successfully bluffs their way in: "Keep an eye out for a blue dragonborn, looks like that" and he'll point to a wanted poster.

>Wanted: [[Faercrath (Fury) Darzgoss]] for the deaths of an entire squad, dereliction of duty, and fleeing from justice. Reward: 2500 gp.

"I've heard he's in the area, maybe even with some friends. He's a dangerous fugitive, not the sort you want to get mixed up with. Enjoy your time in the city."

## Encounter 3 - The prison
At the entrance is 3 [[Dragonborn Guards]], with an additional 5 around the corner. All but one are silver, the dungeon captain is gold.

Tabber and Corom are locked in the southwest corner. Just north of them is the Druid Ballar. The prison doors and windows are warded against magic. 

Their belongings are in a locked chest in the southeast central room. That chest is trapped, it requires a DC 20 investigation check to spot the dart. A DC 20 sleight of hand with thieves tools will unlock it without triggering the trap, or 15 will unlock it but trigger the trap. Any less and the trap is triggered. It's a dart coated in a powerful paralysis poison (DC 18 CON save to resist the effect).
