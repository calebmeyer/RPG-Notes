A large cluster of islands in the eastern sea. The ancestral home of the dragonborn. [[Faercrath (Fury) Darzgoss]] is from here, along with his father, [[Rogar Darzgoss]]. 

The primary pair of islands are Fidrift and Mel'Kar. They're surrounded by many smaller islands, only a few of which are named. The capitol is Kel'Rod, a bustling port city where most of the population of the islands lives. 

# Kel'Rod, the Capitol
Kel'Rod is a large port city. It does a brisk trade exporting Red Bananas, Blaze Melons, Shade Peppers, and other delicacies, as well as demonstrand, a red fiber that makes very strong and lightweight ropes and clothing. In exchange, it receives metals and gems from the dwarven mines, TODO from the elven forests, and TODO from the human cities.
