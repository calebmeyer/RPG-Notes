These smooth stones can be any color, but always come in pairs. Once per day, you can place your hand on the stone and focus on the stone's light. Spend one minute then attempt a DC 20 Arcana check.

On a success, the stone's glow envelopes all creatures in a 10-foot radius with its light and attempts to teleport the creatures to its paired stone. If there is no open space within 30 feet of the target waystone, the teleportation attempt fails. An unwilling creature can resist the teleportation with a successful DC 15 Wisdom save.
