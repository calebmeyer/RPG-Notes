The gang returns to town to talk about their findings to [[Duke Jet of Cardaye]]. He pays them once again.
He mentions there being two conflicting gangs in his portion of the kingdom: the Blood Suns and the Harvest Moons. One focuses on blood rituals, the other the harvesting of souls for [[Pravus, the Evil One]]. “The most I’ve been able to find out is that they have taken over some of the cities in the area. I am not sure which ones. All of my spies seem to go missing after about a week’s time. I have contact, and then nothing. I had stopped sending people until I could find a party strong enough to deal with a cult or two.
“ I’ll pay handsomely for these confusticated cultists to be wiped out.”

You head toward the town of [[Larnwick]] which was about 2-3 days away.

You noticed that there was a tremendous amount of smoke above the town. You all hurried in and saved as many townsfolk as you could.

You also decided to send the survivors on a caravan to [[Autumnmoore]] to get medical help. (edited)

Continuing on through the burned remains of the town, you discover a necromancer banishing spirits in the town. After a brief misunderstanding, he introduces himself as Elissar. He tells you that most of the town was murder, and their spirits are not at peace. You learn:
Necromancers are not generally evil unless they are tempted by the ways of Pravus. It is their job to help the spirits of the world cross over into the afterlife. He tells the party that they can find the cult at fault (Harvest Moons) in the city of Tarmsworth south of here. There are rumors of other towns falling to the three cults around here:

1. The Blood Suns of Azmarin
2. The Fallen Stars of Ravenbourne
3. The Harvest Moons of Tarmsworth

The Blood Suns focus on blood rituals. The Harvest Moons commit arson and "harvest" souls. The Fallen Stars topple governments through corruption.

Before finding [[Elissar]], the flying rogue saw some children being kidnapped by a few cultists and disappearing through a portal.
