We lead off with Nim in an unknown location, trapped in a cell. Her makeshift lockpick finally works, and she breaks out. She finds a lake, and across it a room full of children. A little girl screams, and we cut...

To Corom and Tabber, who are at the sly maiden. We successfully woo 8 noble families (thanks in no small part to Corom's ring of the duke and wings), including the only good Zanardi, and get 400 gold and 8 guards to help us. 

At the same time, Rawnh, Fury, and Timothy? head off to the servants' speakeasy. Alexei stops to pick up two kegs of booze at the tavern along the way, then gets them to a normal looking house. After confirming the password (BOOZE), they are let in, and find two Zanardi servants among the many others. They convince the servants to step outside, then intimidate them into telling the party information about the mansion and also into going to get the armor and weapons back for Rawnh.

Hruuk and Amelia commence mission: impossible, and Hruuk wild shapes into a rat. Amelia summons her familiars, and they explore the mysterious garden. A person appears suddenly, and investigating finds a flower that teleports anyone who touches it into a dungeon. Hruuk and Scabbers find a guard room, some man eating plants, and the scent of Nim. Then they find 6 cultists surrounding 2 circles, one with a child in it.

Hruuk cannot leave a child behind, so he and scabbers scamper up a cultist each. Hruuk de-transforms, but not very successfully and ends up stuck in a cultist's clothes, which rip, depositing him on the floor. He grabs the kid and runs around the corner, leaving the startled cultists wondering what hit them. Hruuk and Russell sneak past the guards and out to the garden, which is too much for the poor kid, who passes out.

As we transition back to Nim, she realizes she has to do something for this room full of kids. They tell her that the bad guys in orange come and take one of them every once in a while, and those kids never come back. She asks where they are taken, and the kids point to the far wall. Nim finds a sigil there, traces it with her finger, and nearly falls through the now intangible wall. She finds a portal and tries to convince the kids to come with her, but they are scared and elect to stay. Nim traverses the portal and finds herself in an abandoned cathedral in [[Asmarin]]. She goes back and convinces the kids to come with her and cements her status as Madeline.

Timothy?, Rawnh, and Fury send Rawnh's rat Sebastien to find Hruuk and Amelia, which works. They devise a plan to steal the teleportation flower (an incredible idea from everyone's favorite barbarian!), and Timothy? is renamed to Blake? (pronounced Bah-lah-kay). The party decides to go find Tabber and Corom before going in.


Meanwhile Corom has delegated effectively, and we have added two mercenaries (see above) to the 8 guards. We see the party and everyone gets all caught up on the happenings. We decide as a party to have the 10 NPCs take out the outer guards and surround the Zanardi household while the PCs (and Thomas Goldlow and Frederick Zanardi) are going to the dungeon to take out the guards and the cultists.

Will Nim figure out what to do with the children? Will Rawnh finally get to hit something? Will the larger party be able to save any more kids? Next time on CnC...
