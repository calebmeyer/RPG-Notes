After our big bandit battle, Corom rides up on a horse, servants wheezing along behind. Tabber reads the slightly burned note the bandit captain had on him aloud:

> Dear Viscountess Eliana,
I hope this letter finds you well as I wouldn't want these payments to stop coming. If you want to continue to buy yourself some time, I demand another 500 gold pieces be delivered at the usual location by the end of the autumnal equinox. Otherwise your time will be up.
Sincerely <too burned to read>

Corom tells us that the Viscountess is his mother, so we interrogate the bandits. They were of course after the 500gp bribe. Corom and Hruuk disagree about the best method of extracting information, but Corom is faster and punches a bandit in the face. Karlan (our new bard friend) steps in and casts Charm Person, which gets us much farther. We find out that the bandits had mugged a dark haired 20 something male courier for his gold and that letter, and had been trying to find the forest location.

We have to decide what to do with the bandits. Corom advocates cutting off their thumbs and big toes, but the group overrules him and we send them off naked into the woods, after Amelia hexes one to know whether they try to do anything bad in the future. Hruuk has some mercy and gives them a pair of good-berries each so they won't starve. The charmed bandit (whom the group thinks just saw the error of his ways), one Edmond the scout, is sent off clothed and unharmed.

After that, we all settle down around the campfire. We tell Corom of O'Malley's new name, and everyone talks a bit about their pasts. Rawnh goes off to catch fireflies. During our chatting, Tabber breaks out some marshmallows. This lures Rawnh back to the fire. We learn that O'Malley was heading to a temple, and Hruuk is searching for the "Garden of Alam". We all catch Karlan up on recent events while he plays a soft tune on his fiddle.

Then we all go to bed in our own ways. Rawnh snuggles Lil Sebastien (the giant goat). Fury chucks a rock the size of Tabber into the ground and uses it as a pillow. Several party members retire to trees. Corom's servants set him up a palatial tent. Tabber spends first watch in a pop up contraption tent working on (and finishing up) an anti-gravity belt for a paralyzed young boy back in the Duke's care. Hruuk and Amelia have a heart to heart on the second watch.


In the morning, we eat breakfast and head off to Everton. When we get there, we hear loud crying, and find a bunch of eviscerated bodies. The people tell us that cultists dressed in red have been taking the blood off in jars.

We begin to investigate. Hruuk wild shapes into a wolf and tries in vain to pick up a scent. Tabber sees a teenager run off, and many of the party give pursuit, also in vain. The people tell us that the cultists have been taking children. Hruuk transforms back to a half orc to ritual cast detect magic. Meanwhile, Fury climbs a building to watch for suspicious activity, Amelia searches the bodies and finds an herbalism kit, and Nim smashes pots looking for rupees.

When detect magic finishes, we find out that all the bodies were an adventuring troop like ours, and they were all magical. Some of the townsfolk's minds have been messed with, and one little girl is not as she seems. Amelia and Hruuk go see what's up, and Amelia realizes she's a tiefling, and helps her escape with soothing words in infernal (seems an oxymoron to me?) and an invisibility spell. Nim loots the bodies. (being a rogue means never having to say you're sorry)

When the party finds out that the girl is a tiefling (and scared), Nim reveals that she is also a tiefling (the party did not know previously). We all mill about for a bit, unsure what to do for this girl (who doesn't want to be a tiefling). Fury offers her comfort and his cloak.

A teenage boy seeks us out, tells us his name is Dominic and he know's what's going on. He tells us the cultists are in Asmarin, but the town of Everton is cursed. We find out the girl's name is Zinnia, and many children have been taken, transformed into tieflings, and returned to town. The mind manipulation has made sure that nobody notices. This has happened at least 5 times in Dom's memory, though he doesn't fully trust it.

Rawnh goes off to take a shower while we send Dominic and Amelia to retrieve the other kids. Hruuk sends a status update to the Duke via animal messenger and Siri heads off to find Karlan, the only person we know with any hope of breaking a curse.

Will we be able to save Everton? Will we be able to console Zinnia and the other children (or even better return them to being human)? What evil machinations will the cultists get up to in Asmarin while we're away? Tune in next time to find out!
