Most of the party slept at the Goldlow house. Hruuk, Blake?, and Amelia find a dead Fred(erick) in the forest, and Hruuk makes some pointed small talk on the way back. Blake? and Amelia dodge the questions, and it's decided that all three of them are strange.

Hruuk helps them stealthily enter the city, but the butler makes them wait for Corom to vouch for them. They stash Fred in the freezer and head to a very late bedtime.

The next morning, Corom's servants get him breakfast, while the rest of the well slept party go across the street for some breakfast. It's amazing, and the shop owner sheepishly asks Fury to try his hot sauce. Much of the group joins in, but no one can take the heat like Nim, who wins 5 gold for her troubles.

The rest of the party wakes up and we all go to the town square for the execution of the elder Zanardi. Corom gives a stirring speech. Nim stabs her old man. He dies.

Invis-Amelia and Blake? follow the guards, and Blake? burns the body. Invis-Amelia taunts Blake? who gets renamed Enrique?

Thanks to a well timed comment from Enrique?, Tabber remembers his sack full of fuzzy balls. Rawnh gets little Sebastien the giant goat. Enrique? gets a boar. Amelia gets my goat as well.

After the execution, we all head to the Dairiticiary, where Tabber fixes Fizzlesprocket's ice cream maker. Fury stops along the way there to check on Sable and give her his brooch of protection. In the restaurant, we all introduce ourselves to Erin (who might be Amelia's sister, though Amelia vehemently denies it), and Enrique? corrects that his name is actually "Ope, gotta go." The party draws straws to rename him, and now Tim? is O'Malley (aka Ye Kilted One).

From there we do some shopping. At the magic shop, we pick up a scroll of identify, a magic lightning infusion for Fury's longsword, and some knowledge about the artifacts we took from the cult (see above). At the magic smith, Amelia picks up a +1 longbow.

On the way to [[Asmarin]], we meet a halfling bard named [[Karlan Everstar]]. He treats us to a beautiful song about a lady who loved a man so much that she begged the gods for help and broke the curse clouding his mind so they could be together. Then we get attacked by bandits.

In the bandit fight, one particularly ugly thug seems "drawn" to the fire (drawn by several members of the party). Karlan charms a scout, and the captain gets shut down hard. Eventually the remaining bandits surrender and we tie them up.

Next time, join us as we travel to [[Everton]], along our way to [[Asmarin]] to stamp out the rest of the cultist activity in the region (hopefully).
